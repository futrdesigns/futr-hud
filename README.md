# futr-hud
A simple and clean HUD for QBCore and ESX.

## Installation
1. Grab the resource from the **Releases** tab.
2. Unzip it and drop the folder into your `resources` directory (like `scripts`, `standalone`, etc.).
3. Open the config file and set everything up however you like.
4. For the logo:
   - Go to `html/assets/img`
   - Add your logo named `logo.png`
   - Adjust any logo settings in the config.

## Extra Stuff
Thanks for downloading and using this! I'm pretty tired so this was made fairly quickly.  
There isn’t a support Discord yet, but one will probably be made soon.  
The project is open-source, so feel free to edit it, fork it, or do whatever you want with it.
